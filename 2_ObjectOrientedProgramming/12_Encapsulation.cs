/// Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates,

/// In simple words, encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
/// We use access modifiers to achieve encapsulation.
/// public: Code in any assembly can access this type or member. The accessibility level of the containing type controls the accessibility level of public members of the type.
///private: Only code declared in the same class or struct can access this member.
///protected: Only code in the same class or in a derived class can access this type or member.
///internal: Only code in the same assembly can access this type or member.
///protected internal: Only code in the same assembly or in a derived class in another assembly can access this type or member.
///private protected: Only code in the same assembly and in the same class or a derived class can access the type or member.
